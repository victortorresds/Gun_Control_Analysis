## ❓ Objective

This project explores whether **stricter firearm control laws** are associated with **lower firearm mortality rates** in the United States using public health data and gun law scores.

---

## 🔍 Data Sources

- 🧬 **CDC Firearm Mortality Rates**  
  🔗 [CDC Mortality Data](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm)  
  🔗 [CDC Open API](https://open.cdc.gov/apis.html)

- 📜 **Gun Law Grades**  
  Data scraped from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence Scorecard.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

1. 📥 Load and filter 2023 CDC firearm mortality data.
2. 🗃️ Clean and convert gun law grades into a 5-point Likert scale:
   - `1 = Most Lax` 🔴
   - `5 = Most Strict` 🟢
3. 🔗 Merge datasets by state.
4. 🗺️ Create **heatmaps** and **scatterplots** to explore relationships.
5. 📈 Perform visual trend analysis with linear regression.

## 📌 Conclusion

✅ **Yes, stricter firearm control laws are associated with lower firearm mortality.**  
States like **California**, **Connecticut**, and **New Jersey** (with strong laws) have lower gun death rates than states like **Alabama**, **Arizona**, and **Georgia** (with weaker laws).
